# Visualizing

## What is Data?

Data is information! Specifically, it's computer-readable information: numbers \(in binary\). And data is everywhere! We've seen how computers represent internally, and discussed the Internet communication protocols behind transmitting that data. Now, we'll take a closer look at how computers collect, store, manipulate, and visualize information.

Human-readable data encompasses much more than numbers. It includes written text, images, video, and audio recordings. All of these things, of course, can be digitized, which converts unstructured data \(human-readable\) to structured data \(computer-readable\).

### Creating Knowledge

Once data is structured, it gives us the ability to develop that store, process, manipulate, and visualize that data. The combination of data and computation results in an increase in knowledge.

We live in an era where there is a wealth of data.

* Financial transactions
* Personal information
* Medical information
* Web browsing histories
* Measurements about our world

People aren't very good at sifting through this amount of data, but computers are. And using our computational powers, these computers can do a lot of incredible things.

* Extract information
* Identify trends and recognize patterns
* Make connections and predictions
* Recognize and solve problems 

These computing tools allow us to search, filter, store, and visualize information in large datasets.

### Concerns

Storing and efficiently processing large amounts of data is a very unique challenge, as is keeping that data private. Far more information that any of us would probably care to admit is tracked online.

Databases and their associated languages help us to efficiently store and process the information, and various encryption and anonymization technologies have to keep this data private. Make sure you read and understand the privacy policy so you understand how companies will share and sell your information \(because they will!\).

### How to Visualize Data?

Data visualization is the process of using charts, graphs, or images to visualize complex data. It's far easier to understand and extract useful information from data when it's presented in visual form. And it's certainly much faster than reading through thousands of pages of numbers and statistics.

This applies to many fields of study, as computing tools are used for visualization purposes in all of the following industries.

* Science
* Government
* Sports
* Agriculture
* Music
* Economics
* Medicine

Today's technologies have enhanced many of our historic visualization methods. This includes the addition of interactivity, real-time updates, and aesthetic presentation.
