## Cybercrime and Cyberwarfare

All information on the Internet is sent over shared wires: credit card numbers, passwords, emails, bank account transactions. This information is personal, it's valuable, and it can be detrimental in the hands of a malicious actor.

Cybercrime and cyberwarfare are serious threats to individuals, organizations, and governments. Malicious actions perpetrated on the Internet generally land in one of these two camps.

| Cybercrime | Cyberwarfare |
| :--- | :--- |
| Identity theft | Hacking into government systems |
| Theft of money | Controlling communication and transportation |
| Theft of private information | Disrupting public utilities \(energy, water\) |
| Unauthorized access and control of machines |  |

## Common Attacks

There are a host of ways in which malicious actors can infiltrate and disrupt computing systems.

* Denial of Service \(DoS\) and Distributed Denial of Service \(DDoS\)

This is the process by which an actor or group of actors spams a web server with so many requests so close together than the web server crashes or is unable to respond to legitimate requests.

A simple DoS attack involves a single computer launching the attack. A DDoS attack is distributed because the attack is launched from multiple machines simultaneously. In many cases, a hacker has gained control \(through malware\) of many computers and uses them to launch an attack.

* DNS Spoofing

By pretending to be a DNS server, an attacker to redirect requests to malicious websites \(rather than the originally requested website\). It is common that these malicious websites are designed to look almost identical to the real thing. Unless you're paying close attention, you might not even notice you've been redirected elsewhere.

## Security

The solution to these problems and the myriad attacks designed to take advantage of them is cybersecurity.

* Protocols for encrypting and decrypting communications
* Security and antivirus software
* Following prescribed best practices

The majority of security breaches occur as a result of human error, not flaws in the software itself.

### Cryptography

There are two major protocols pertaining to cryptography: Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\) and Transport Layer Security \(TLS\). SSL is outdated, and has been replaced with TLS.

TLS is used in conjunction with HTTP, created an encrypted transfer protocol called HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure \(HTTPS\).

Remember Public Key Encryption? Websites can use the same thing to allow you to communicate with their web servers securely. A website gives you a public key, and something called a Certificate Authority \(CA\) verifies that the public key does, in fact, belong to that website.

### Antivirus Software

Many companies develop antivirus software whose job is to detect and delete malicious programs on your computer or network. It's important to keep these software programs up-to-date, as hackers are constantly working to develop new and more clever malware to evade detection.

### Best Practices

Security is only as strong as the weakest link. So don't be a weak link, and follow these best practices in all of your online activities.

* Use strong passwords
* Don't use the same password across different websites
* Install security updates
* Think twice before clicking a link or installing a program

A strong password means a few different things. Use a variety of letters \(both upper- and lowercase\), numbers, and special characters. Most importantly, though, choose _long_ passwords! The longer your password is, the longer it'll take a computer to programmatically crack it.

Security updates are critical. Operating system, browser, or application updates should be downloaded and installed on a timely basis. If an organization releases a software patch, it's because they found a problem. If that patch is security related, it's a safe bet it's already been exploited.

Use common sense. Don't click links without knowing where it's going to take you, or what it's going to download. If your browser warns you about visiting a particular website or downloading a particular file, you should probably heed its advice!
