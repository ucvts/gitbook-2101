# Performance Tasks

## Overview

In this AP course, your students will complete two through-course performance tasks and an end-of-course written exam.

The AP Computer Science Principles course is designed to be equivalent to a first- semester introductory college computing course. In this course, students will develop computational thinking skills vital for success across all disciplines, such as using computational tools to analyze and study data and working with large data sets to analyze, visualize, and draw conclusions from trends. The course engages students in the creative aspects of the field by allowing them to develop computational artifacts based on their interests. Students will also develop effective communication and collaboration skills by working individually and collaboratively to solve problems, and will discuss and write about the impacts these solutions could have on their community, society, and the world.

### Policy on Plagiarism

A student who fails to acknowledge \(i.e., through citation, through attribution, by reference, and/or through acknowledgment in a bibliographic entry\) the source or author of any and all information or evidence taken from the work of someone else **will receive a score of zero** on that performance task.

A computational artifact without acknowledgement of the media used in the creation of the computational artifact, and program code segment\(s\) written by someone else used in a program without appropriate acknowledgements, **are all considered plagiarized work**.

To the best of my ability, I will ensure that you understand ethical use and acknowledgment of the ideas and work of others, as well as the consequences of plagiarism. Your voice should be clearly evident, and the ideas of others must be acknowledged, attributed, and/or cited.

## Create Task

Programming is a collaborative and creative process that brings ideas to life through the development of software. Programs can help solve problems, enable innovations, or express personal interests. In this Performance Task, you will be developing a program of your choice. Your development process should include iteratively designing, implementing, and testing your program. You are strongly encouraged to work with another student in your class on the development of your program code. Your program development must also involve a significant amount of independent work writing your program code, in particular, algorithm\(s\) and abstraction\(s\) that you select to use as part of your written response to describe how the program code segments help your program run.

Read through the [Assessment Overview and Performance Task Directions](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles) prior to beginning your performance task.

You will be provided with 12 hours of class time to develop, complete, and submit the following:

* A video of your program running
* Individual written responses about your program and development process
* Program Code

### Individual Video \(IV\)

* Submit one video in `.mp4`, `.wmv`, `.avi`, or `.mov` format.
* Your video **must not exceed 1 minute** in length and **must not exceed 30 MB** in size.

For more detailed information related to the Individual Video, please refer to the [Assessment Overview and Performance Task Directions](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles). Scoring Guidelines and Notes for the Create Performance Tasks can be found on the [exam page on AP Central](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-create-performance-task-scoring-guidelines-2019.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles).

#### **Submission Reminder**

Before submitting your work as final, please:

* Remove your name.
* Ensure that you have not collaborated on the development of this video.
* Refrain from publicly posting any portions your performance tasks.

### Individual Written Responses \(IWR\)

* Submit one PDF document in which you respond directly to each prompt.
* Clearly label your responses 2a â€“ 2d in order.
* Your response to all prompts combined **must not exceed 750 words**, exclusive of the Program Code.

For more detailed information related to the Individual Written Responses, please refer to the [Assessment Overview and Performance Task Directions](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles). Scoring Guidelines and Notes for the Create Performance Tasks can be found on the [exam page on AP Central](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-create-performance-task-scoring-guidelines-2019.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles).

#### **Submission Reminder**

Before submitting your work as final, please:

* Remove your name.
* Ensure that you have **not** collaborated on the written responses.
* Refrain from publicly posting any portions your performance tasks.

### Program Code \(PC\)

* Capture and paste your entire program code into the PDF.
* Mark with an **oval** the segment of program code that implements the algorithm you created for your program that integrates other algorithms and integrates mathematical and/or logical concepts.
* Mark with a **rectangle** the segment of program code that represents an abstraction you developed.
* Include comments or acknowledgments for program code that has been written by someone else.

For more detailed information related to the Program Code, please refer to the [Assessment Overview and Performance Task Directions](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles). Scoring Guidelines and Notes for the Create Performance Tasks can be found on the [exam page on AP Central](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-create-performance-task-scoring-guidelines-2019.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles).

#### **Submission Reminder**

Before submitting your work as final, please:

* Remove your name.
* Ensure that you have provided acknowledgement for any program code written by someone else.
* Refrain from publicly posting any portions your performance tasks.

If you're hosting your project on GitHub, the repository should be **private**.
