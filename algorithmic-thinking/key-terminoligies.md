## Thinking Algorithmically

As we dive into algorithmic thinking, and later, programming, it's important to start to wrap our heads around what it means to think like a computer. Here's [a bit of light reading](https://medium.com/tech-based-teaching/if-curious-then-learn-a-brief-intro-to-algorithmic-thinking-ba683bf44994) to get you started!

## What is Computer Science?

While there is more than one definition of computer science, there are a few components that should be part of a correct one. We'll start with a formal definition before breaking down each part of it.

> Computer science is the study of algorithms, including their formal and mathematical properties, their hardware realizations, their linguistic realizations, and their applications.

### Formal and Mathematical Properties

This refers to studying the behavior of algorithms to determine if they are correct and efficient. A correct algorithm is one that solves the problem at hand. An efficient one does so quickly and with as few resources as possible.

### Hardware Realizations

This refers to designing and building computer systems that can execute algorithms. A computer system is any computing device: PCs, laptops, phones, tablets, watches, etc.

### Linguistic Realizations

This refers to designing programming languages and translating algorithms into these languages so they can be executed on the hardware. There are hundreds of programming languages. Some of the more popular ones include JavaScript, Python, C, C++, Java, Swift, etc.

### Applications

This refers to identifying important problems and designing algorithms to solve them. Any program youâ€™ve used \(or one you might write\) is boiled down to a series of problems and the algorithms that solve them.

### Misconceptions

There are three common misconceptions that people hold in regards to what computer science is.

* Computer science is the study of computers.
* Computer science is the study of how to write computer programs.
* Computer science is the study of the uses and applications of computers and software.

These aren't altogether incorrect, but rather incomplete.

## What is an Algorithm?

Again, there is more than one definition of an algorithm. We'll be using the following one.

> An algorithm is a well-ordered collection of unambiguous and effectively computable operations that, when executed, produces a result and halts in a finite amount of time.

Unambiguous means clear. Abundantly clear. Computers are not people. They cannot infer what something might have meant or probably means. They will execute the instructions exactly as given. Effectively computer refers to a computers ability to actually execute an instruction. And an algorithm must be guaranteed to produce a result in a finite amount of time. Essentially, an algorithm that runs forever is not an algorithm.

## Types of Operations

Algorithms are comprised of three types of operations. Though simple, together they can build even the most complex algorithms.

### Sequential

These operations are executed in the order they are written. They typically include input, output, and computations.

### Conditional

These operations are decision-making steps that allow for branching logic. Alternatively, category is sometimes referred to as selection.

### Iterative

These operations are looping structures that allow for repetition of logic.

## Shampoo Algorithm

This is commonly found on the backs of shampoo bottles, for those who need a little help washing their hair.

* Wet hair
* Lather
* Rinse
* Repeat

Does this satisfy the formal definition of an algorithm? It seems straightforward enough, but it actually doesn't qualify as an algorithm. The steps are ambiguous. What are we lathering? Where is the step that instructs us to put the shampoo in our hair? What are we rinsing? Which steps \(and how many times\) should we repeat?

Even if we could argue that these steps are unambiguous, this algorithm does not halt in a finite amount of time. For that reason alone, it does not meet the specifications of the formal definition of an algorithm.
