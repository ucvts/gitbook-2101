# Interpreting

## Data Limitations

There are always limits to data and to our visualizations. Skewing the axis or labels, or omitting important information can result in a misleading graph or chart.

Even more so, we need to be sure we're critical of our sources and methods. The metadata, which refers to data about data, can answer many important questions regarding the dataset.

* Where was this data collected?
* Who collected this data?
* How long ago was this data collected?
* How large is this dataset?
* How accurate is this dataset?

The questions we can ask \(and more importantly answer\) might be limited by the extent of our data. If we only collect data from a certain year or from a certain country, it will certainly limit the trends we can establish and predictions we can make.
