# Course Syllabus

## Course Description

AP Computer Science Principles introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer science. In this course, students will learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs. They will incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge. Students will also explain how computing innovations and computing systems, including the Internet, work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that is collaborative and ethical. It is important to note that the AP Computer Science Principles course does not have a designated programming language. Teachers have the flexibility to choose a programming language\(s\) that is most appropriate for their students to use in the classroom.

## Topic Outline

This course consists of 10 units of instruction.

* Algorithmic Thinking
* An Introduction to JavaScript
* Language Fundamentals
* Control Structures
* Functions and Data Structures
* JavaScript in the Browser
* Digital Information
* The Internet
* Data
* Beyond the Exam

## Suggested Texts

I recommend you purchase one \(or both!\) of the following texts. They each provide practice tests, study guides, and helpful hints and tips for the AP exam.

* 5 Steps to a 5: AP Computer Science Principles
* Barron's AP Computer Science Principles

Make sure you purchase the 2020-2021 versions of these books.

## Grading Policy

Marking period grades are comprised of tests, quizzes, and programming assignments.

* Quizzes \(up to 25 points\)
* Problem Sets \(up to 50 points\)
* Tests \(up to 100 points\)
* Projects \(up to 150 points\)

Tests and quizzes each assess skills presented during class, in the required readings and videos, or through applicable programming assignments and activities.

## Performance Task

The AP Computer Science Principles exam is unique in that it requires the completion and submission of a project-like assignment called a Performance Task. This assignment, coupled with the end-of-course written exam, comprises your overall AP score. There are ample opportunities to review requirements, analyze previous yearsâ€™ samples, and, of course, practice!

## Late Policy

The world is full of deadlines, and you need to learn to prioritize and manage your time accordingly. There will be a 10% daily penalty levied against all late submissions. After the ninth day, submissions will no longer be accepted.

## Attendance Policy

If you are absent for a test or quiz, it is your responsibility to schedule a makeup date within one week of returning to school. I mark assignments \(temporarily\) with a zero in PowerSchool to serve as reminder. If you have not made up the assignment after a week, the zero becomes permanent. All programming assignments are distributed and submitted electronically. Absence from class, without documented extenuating circumstances, does not excuse your failure to complete and submit assignments on time.

## Academic Integrity

You are expected to complete assignments independently. Using code that is not your own, whether it is that of a classmate or a third-party source, is not permissible unless explicitly noted in writing. Failure to abide by these conditions results in a zero for the assignment. No exceptions. Please be sure you have read your school's Honor Code and that you understand the consequences of violating it.
